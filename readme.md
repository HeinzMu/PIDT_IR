This library is to control brushed dc motors with the Arduino Mega2560.
The library is NOT tested for any other board.
For all boards not supporting Timer3 it will not work because Timer3 is used for fast PWM.

The example is prepared to debug with the avr_debugger.
Using it with the avr_degubber the debugger must be enabled.
If it doesn't work try another interrupt for the degugger.
