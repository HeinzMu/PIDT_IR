Heinz MÃ¼ller created this library to control brushed dc motors with the Arduino Mega2560.
This library is NOT tested for any other board.
For all boards not supporting Timer3 it will not work because Timer3 is used for fast PWM.

The example is prepared to debug with the avr_debugger.
Using it with the avr_degubber the debugger must be enabled.
If it doesn't work try another interrupt for the degugger.
A working version for me is in the example directory.
